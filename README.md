## Nesty Hash
You can see Nesty Hash live [https://nesty-hash.herokuapp.com/](https://nesty-hash.herokuapp.com/).

#### About
Nesty Hash is a tool I designed to help my programming students gain more experience with nested data structures. It allows the user to randomly generate nested data structures by selecting data structures to include and a maximum nesting depth.

#### Features
This project uses [react ace](https://github.com/securingsincity/react-ace) to display the data structure snippets. The CSS is [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) along with some custom CSS Grid.

#### Installation
Nesty Hash was bootstrapped with [create react app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To install, fork and clone this repository. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm start` to start a server on `http://localhost:3000/`.
